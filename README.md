# Microhouse 

MicroHouse is a high-performance, one-bed house type, designed using the WikiHouse Wren building system. It has been designed primarily for use in the UK, but could also be adapted for other countries and regions. The home can be largely self-assembled, and costs around £37-45k GBP to produce. 

These files are also intended as starter files for architects, designers, engineers and others interested in getting to know how to use the WikiHouse WREN system within a full design.
